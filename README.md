# React - Address Book Part 2

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository
2. `npm ci` to install dependencies
3. `npm run dev` to run the application
4. Build a simple React app using the plans you created during part 1

## API

Use [these Contacts API endpoints](https://boolean-api-server.fly.dev/api-docs/#/contact) for your data.

## Core Criteria

- The [requirements outlined in part 1](https://github.com/boolean-uk/react-address-book-part-1/tree/main#requirements) are the minimum requirements for this exercise.
- Your application must match your plan. If you need to deviate, you must update your plan.
- Navigation **must** be done using routes, not conditional rendering

## Extensions

1. Allow for deleting a contact

2. Allow for updating a contact's information

3. Automatically navigate to the contact list after deleting a contact

4. Automatically navigate to the single contact information view after updating a contact

5. Implement the remaining contact properties available in the API into your application

6. Use a contact's `latitude` and `longitude` geo-coordinates to render their position on a map

7. Add the ability to filter the contact list

## Example application

**Note: Your application does not need to look like this.**l
